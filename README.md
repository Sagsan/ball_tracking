Ball Tracker: A Video Analyst
What does it do?

This program is like a super sleuth for videos. It watches clips and follows colorful balls around. It's especially good at noticing when a ball zips into a new area. Think of it as a digital referee for a bouncy ball game!

How does it work?

Video In: Drop your video file into the same folder as this program.
Ball Watch: The program scans the video frame by frame, looking for yellow, green, white, or orange balls.
Area Check: It divides the screen into four zones. Every time a ball moves into a new zone, it's like a little event!
Data Out: The program creates two files:
A cool video showing the balls and what they're up to.
A text file with a play-by-play of all the ball moves.
Want to change things up?

You can tweak the program to:

Find different colored balls.
Look for bigger or smaller balls.
Divide the screen into different zones.
Important Note: This program is a starting point. There's lots of room for improvement! You could make it even smarter by teaching it to tell balls apart or handle when balls get in each other's way.
